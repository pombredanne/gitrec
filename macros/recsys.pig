 * Step 2 of the default collaborative filter.
 *
 * The item-to-item links outputted by Step 1 (Recsys__UIScores_To_IILinks)
 * do not account for the popularity of the item linked to. Without accounting
 * for this, popular items will be considered "most-similar" for every other item,
 * since users of the other items frequently interact wit the popular item.
 *
 * This macro uses Bayes theorem to avoid this problem, and also scaled the
 * item-to-item links to all be within the range [0, 1]. It sets the similarity
 * of repos A and B to be an estimate of the probability that a random user U
 * will interact with A given that they interacted with B. In mathematical notation,
 * it similarity(A, B) = P(A | B). This way, if B is very popular, you need a lot
 * of users co-interacting with it and A for the link to be statistically significant.
 *
 * This estimation breaks down if B is very unpopular, with only a few users interacting with it.
 * If B only has 2 users and they all interacted with A, that is most likely due to chance, not similarity.
 * The macro therefore takes a Bayesian Prior, which guards against these small sample sizes.
 * Intuitively, it represents a number of "pseudo-observations" of the non-similarity of A and B;
 * or in other words, A is "innocent of B until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt".
